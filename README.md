# ztmy

ztmy is a concert viewer for Zutomayo concerts. Features include concert setlist (and timestamps), lyrics alongside the video (Japanese with furigana and autogenerated romaji), song search, and song info (including what concerts the song is in).

## Web

This was made using sveltekit, but it it can be completely prerendered, meaning it can build and become a static site.

### Running Instructions

`git clone https://github.com/jetstream0/ztmy`

`npm i`

`npm run build` (will build a static version of the site in the `build` directory) or `npm run dev` (run a version of the site locally)

If you want to build the tauri app, switch to the `tauri` branch. Then,

`cargo run build` or `cargo-tauri build`

Also, default video sources can be set in `/src/lib/data/video_config.json`, and when running this locally (and using default video sources), you may want to upload the video files in `/static` as `file://` links likely won't work.

## Desktop App

Made with tauri. See the releases (todo: link) to download.

The desktop app also features a basic [CLI](/docs/CLI.md).
