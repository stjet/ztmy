# ztmy

ztmy is a concert viewer for Zutomayo concerts. Features include concert setlist (and timestamps), lyrics alongside the video (Japanese with furigana and autogenerated romaji), song search, and song info (including what concerts the song is in).

## Web

This was made using sveltekit, but it it can be completely prerendered, meaning it can build and become a static site.

### Running Instructions

`git clone https://github.com/jetstream0/ztmy`

`npm i`

`npm run build` (will build a static version of the site in the `build` directory) or `npm run dev` (run a version of the site locally)

## Desktop App

Made with tauri. See the releases (todo: link) to download.

The desktop app also features a basic [CLI](/docs/CLI.md).

Obviously, the fonts, lyrics, and album cover images are not under my copyright. The OFL (Open Font License) applies to both the fonts. The lyrics and album cover are under Zutomayo's copyright, probably. The favicon (the horrible drawing of the hedgehog) was made by me, feel free to use it.
